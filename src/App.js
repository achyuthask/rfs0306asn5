        Mountain View was integral to the early history and growth of Silicon Valley, and is the location of many high technology companies.
         In 1956, William Shockley established Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in Mountain View, the first company to develop 
         silicon semiconductor devices in Silicon Valley. Today, Mountain View houses the headquarters of many of the world's largest 
         technology companies, including Google and Alphabet Inc., Unicode Consortium, Intuit, NASA Ames Research Center, and major
          former and current headquarter offices for Microsoft, Symantec, 23andMe, LinkedIn, Samsung, and Synopsys.

          A forest is an area of land dominated by trees.[1] Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density,
           tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function.[2][3][4] The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
            defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, 
            or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use."[5]
             Using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020) found that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares 
             (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square kilometres; 15.7 million square miles), or approximately 31 percent of the world's 
             land area in 2020

        A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of a few haploid cells which produce gametes. The "male" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte is contained within the ovule. When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination. Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from the same flower or a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species
