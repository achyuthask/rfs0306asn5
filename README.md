# In React.js, "props" (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props allow you to customize and configure child components with dynamic values or functions that are defined in the parent component. This enables you to create reusable and modular components that can be easily customized based on their usage.
# In the parent component, you can pass data to a child component by including attributes with values inside the JSX tags of the child component.
# In the child component, you can access the passed props using the props object.
# The child component can use the received props to display data or perform actions. Props can be used within the child component's JSX as well as in its logic.
